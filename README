Simple Shell

This program acts as a UNIX shell that can process commands and redirect file I/O requests.

Limitations:

  An important note about this program:
    If file descriptors are opened for I/O and a --command references them
    correctly then they will be used. If a --command incorrectly references
    a file descriptor number that has not shown up yet then an error is thrown
    and the program terminates.

    If no files are passed by the user then the command throws an error when issuing
    a command due to no files being open for use. (This is an update from my
    Lab 1a where I defaulted to stdin, stderr, and stdout.)


Additional information:
  My program parses input arguments using getopt_long.
  When a --command option is entered, I extract the given information/args
  for that given command by searching for the next string that contains a "--".
  If there is one found then we know we can move on and execute the command
  because we have received all of the arguments associated with the given command.
